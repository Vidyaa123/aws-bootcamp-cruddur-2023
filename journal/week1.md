## Tasks to Complete
- [**MY NOTES**](#my-notes)<br>

### Chirag's Pricing/Spending Considerations for Week 1
#### Gitpod 
- check the pricing calculator on the gitpod.io website to stay within 50 hours of usage per month for free.
- Becomes inactive after 30 mins of no activity
- Last week I have consumed used most of my Gitpod free tier credits. I have just 49.99 cresits remaining for the rest of the month. 
- I have to make sure I stick to the time limit.

#### Github Codespaces
- 60 hours free usage for 2 core or 30 hours for 4 core.
- I havent started using codespaces yet, so should be fine for now

#### AWS Cloud9 
- free for 12 months
- dont use cloud9 if using t2.micro instance for any other purpose - it adds up the ec2 usage

#### AWS Cloudtrail
- avoid using Cloudtrail
- stores logs for 90 days
- do not opt for data and other insights.
