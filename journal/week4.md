    - Enable CloudTrail to trigger alerts on malicioud behaviour by anu identity
    - Enable Guardduty in the same region as RDS
    - Dont use default autentication(use IAM authentication, Kerberos etc)
    - Database user Lifecycle Management(create, delete & modify users)
    - User Access Lifecycle management (create, delete & revoke access to users)
    - RTestrict security groups to known IPs
    - Not internet accessible
